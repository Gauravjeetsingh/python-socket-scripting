# How to use
After cloning this repo, use server file to sends message to the connected client<br>

Make sure server and client are on same network.<br>
Do python server.py on server machine. It will ask you for ip address of system.<br>
Do python client.py on client machine.It will ask you for ip address of server.<br>
